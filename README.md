# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to uncover trends in sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency.  I analyzed four detailed datasets to answer 13 key business questions. The analysis provided insights into sales growth over time, popular pizza choices among customers, and areas to improve operational processes, helping inform data-driven strategies for business growth.
